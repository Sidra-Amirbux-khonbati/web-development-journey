        <article id="article">My name is Sidra Amirbux, and I am currently a BS Software Engineering student at SZABIST University. I consider myself  a curious learner who believes in steady growth rather than instant success.
         From the beginning of my academic journey, I have been interested in technology and problem-solving. Software engineering attracted me because it combines logic, creativity, and real-world impact. I have basic knowledge of C programming, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Git, and I am continuously working to improve my technical skills. Recently, I have also started exploring Java, Object-Oriented Programming, and Flutter, which has helped me understand how software systems are designed in real life.
         Apart from technical skills, I strongly believe in the importance of communication and teamwork. Participating in group projects, presentations, and competitions has helped me build confidence and learn how to work effectively with others. Although English is not my first language, I am actively improving my speaking and writing skills because I believe communication is essential for personal and professional growth.
         Like every student, I have faced challenges in my academic journey. However, these challenges have taught me patience, consistency, and self-belief. I try to view difficulties as opportunities to learn rather than obstacles. My goal is not only to become a skilled software engineer but also a responsible individual who contributes positively to society. In the future, I aim to work in the field of technology where I can continue learning, growing, and making a meaningful impact. I believe that with dedication, discipline, and the right mindset, continuous improvement is always possible.</article>
